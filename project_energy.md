## Visualization and Analysis of Power Consumption Time Series

Many households are now equipped with smart meters, devices that record energy consumption down to the minute. These meters generate enormous amounts of data, making it challenging to analyze with just an Excel spreadsheet. Accurate analysis of one's power consumption can be crucial for optimizing energy usage and reducing costs.

On this website, I present several projects where I have utilized advanced visualization and analytical techniques to make sense of these vast datasets. By leveraging tools such as Python and specialized libraries, I have developed insights that offer a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns.

In my GitHub repository you will find notebooks that demonstrate various data processing, visualization, and analytical methods. These notebooks are designed to provide a hands-on experience and to showcase the power of modern data science tools in the realm of energy consumption analysis.

### Visualization of Typical Patterns

Here we see the raw data from a private household.

Not very informative yet... Many consumers use varying amounts of energy depending on the season. Therefore, we can segment the time series into different seasons and examine the average weekdays.

We can also depict the trends throughout the day for different weekdays and seasons.

Here's an example of a consumer with strong seasonality.

### Classification of Typical Days
Classifying Typical Days

This power consumption time series belongs to a school. An algorithm—a model—can be trained to distinguish between school days, weekends, and holidays based on power consumption.

In this example, we can clearly see significant differences between school days and weekends.

A trained model can now distinguish between school days and weekends or holidays.
