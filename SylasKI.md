### Synthetic Load Time Series for Energy System Analysis Using Artificial Intelligence Methods (SyLasKI)
Generating Synthetic Load Time Series for Energy System Analysis Using AI Methods

The [SyLasKI](https://www.iee.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte/suche/2021/sylas-ki) project, we generated synthetic load time series. Load time series of various user types are crucial for forecasts and targeted planning. However, real load time series contain user-specific information that can lead to de-anonymization and are subject to GDPR regulations. Therefore, the project's goal is to generate synthetic load time series that closely resemble real load time series of different user types.

We have used and compared different methods, including Generative Adversarial Networks, Hidden Markov Models and Diffusion Models. The project results are currently being prepared for publication.
