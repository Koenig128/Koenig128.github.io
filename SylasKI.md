Generating Synthetic Load Time Series for Energy System Analysis Using AI Methods

In the SyLas-KI project, we generated synthetic load time series. Load time series of various user types are crucial for forecasts and targeted planning. However, real load time series contain user-specific information that can lead to de-anonymization and are subject to GDPR regulations. Therefore, the project's goal is to generate synthetic load time series that closely resemble real load time series of different user types.
